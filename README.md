# Glacial Cycles Simulator

This project implements modular models of glacial-interglacial cycles, allowing flexible simulation of ice volume, climate forcing, and feedbacks.

## Features
- Base model abstraction with state management
- Ice volume model
- Simulation orchestration
- Utility functions for analysis & plotting

## Installation
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd glacial_cycles
pip install -r requirements.txt
